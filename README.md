# OffAxisProjection

Unfinished project that tries to create off axis perspective shifting using on gyroscopic commands from your phone. 

Code is based upon TheParralaxView by algomystic: https://github.com/algomystic/TheParallaxView

The implemented algorithm was originally described by Robert Kooima in his publication "Generalized Perspective Projection": http://160592857366.free.fr/joe/ebooks/ShareData/Generalized%20Perspective%20Projection.pdf
